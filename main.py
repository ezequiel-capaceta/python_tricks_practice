# Problem 1: Write a lambda function to sort a list of tuples in ascending 
# order according to the number in the second position of each tuple.

# Problem 2: Write a lambda function to cube every element of a list

# Problem 3: Write a lambda function to determine whether a number is even 
# or odd (the function should return True or False), and then use the 
# function and a list comprehension to create a new list of booleans, 
# where even numbers are True and odd numbers are False.

# Problem 4: Use a list comprehension to create a list of the numbers from 
# 1 to 100 (including 100).

# Problem 5: Use a dictionary comprehension to count the length of each 
# word in a sentence.
